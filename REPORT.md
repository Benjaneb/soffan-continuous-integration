### Reflection

<br>

Our team is currently in the **Seeded** state, transitioning toward **Formed**. While we have successfully addressed the requirements of the **Formed** stage – such as understanding individual responsibilities, establishing communication channels, and committing to the project – we are technically held back from fully achieving the Seeded state due to a lack of formal **governance rules** and a defined **leadership model**. Currently, our leadership is emergent and informal rather than determined, and our governance relies on implicit academic standards rather than a team-specific agreement.

The primary obstacle to reaching the **Formed** state is the formalization of these two areas. To progress, we must explicitly define how decisions are made (governance) and who facilitates specific team functions (leadership) to ensure the team is fully "formed" and ready to "collaborate" efficiently.
